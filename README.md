# Sl√ºgg

The purpose of this app is to provide an example of how to best format an app submission on [Github](http://github.com) for a hackathon. If you'd like to suggest changes or improvements to this example, feel free to send me a pull request.

This application was developed on February 5th, 2015 for the [Evergreen Awesome Hackthon](http://example.com/this-goes-nowhere).

Our app is live at http://example.com/awesome-app-that-doesnt-exist. You can log in as the demo user "unicorns" with password "sartfarkles". You can also check out [this demo screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of our application on YouTube.

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for [Challenge #3: Build an app that provides an example of an Awesome Hackathon submission](http://example.com/this-also-goes-nowhere).

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Develop an example Git repository
- Share it on Github
- Collect feedback from the community

Once we did that, we knew we were guaranteed to win!
